Basic layout

When you first open RStudio, you will be greeted by three panels:

    The interactive R console (entire left)
    Workspace/History (tabbed in upper right)
    Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, a scripting panel will also open in the top left.
Work flow within Rstudio

There are two main ways one can work within Rstudio.

    Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later.
    This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
    Becomes laboursome.
    Start writing in an .R file and use Rstudioâ€™s command / short cut to push current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.
    This is great way to start and work as all workings are saved for latter reference and can be read latter.

Tip: Pushing to the interactive R console

To run the current line click on the Run button just above the file pane. Or use the short cut which can be see by hovering the mouse over the button.

To run a block of code, select it and then Run. If you have modified a line of code within a block of code you have just run. There is no need to reselct the section and Run, you can use the next button along, Re-run the previous region. This will run the previous code block inculding the modifications you have made.
